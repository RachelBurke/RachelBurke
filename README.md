### Hi there, I am Rachel Purdum! ðŸ‘‹

I am a proud 2-time graduate of Butler University and am a software developer at Crew Carwash. In May 2023, I completed my Master in Business Administration at Butler University. My career goal is to work in IT management and find innovative ways for business and technology to come together to achieve company goals.
